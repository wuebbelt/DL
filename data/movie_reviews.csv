Toy story,Children will enjoy a new take on the irresistible idea of toys coming to life. Adults will marvel at a witty script and utterly brilliant anthropomorphism.,fresh

Toy story,"How perfect that two of the most popular funny guys around, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, speak for the lead boy-toys.",fresh
Toy story,The result is a visionary roller-coaster ride of a movie.,fresh
Toy story,"Disney's witty, wondrously imaginative, all-computer-generated cartoon is far and away the best of the new holiday movies in town.",fresh
Toy story,Disney's first computer-made animated feature is a 3-D eye popper.,fresh
Toy story,"The script, by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft, is filled with clever gags that keep the two heroes at each other's throats and the plot on fast- forward.",fresh
Toy story,The one big negative about Toy Story involves Disney's overcommercialization.,fresh
Toy story,"Technically, Toy Story is nearly flawless.",fresh
Toy story,It's a nice change of pace to see the studio draw magic from this modern tale about ordinary 20th-century kid Andy and his eager-to-please playthings.,fresh

Toy story,"The great voice acting, the visual puns, all added up to an animation game changer.",fresh
Jumanji,"A gloomy special-effects extravaganza filled with grotesque images, generating fear and despair.",rotten
Jumanji,A calculated but very entertaining special effects extravaganza.,fresh
Grumpy Old Men,Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are awfully good at this sort of thing.,fresh
Grumpy Old Men,"Mediocre, regrettably.",rotten
Grumpy Old Men,"Just don't expect their bickering to be on the level of Neil Simon, and you won't be disappointed.",fresh
Grumpy Old Men,"While it won't come close to my top 10 best list for 1993, it will be right up there among the pictures that I had the most fun watching.",fresh
Grumpy Old Men,"The movie is too pat and practiced to really be convincing, and the progress of Ariel's relationships with the two grumps seems dictated mostly by the needs of the screenplay.",rotten
Grumpy Old Men,"If you poke through Grumpy's cheap sentimentality, you'll find a worthy picture somewhere.",fresh
Waiting to Exhale,Never escapes the queasy aura of Melrose Place: just another story about beautiful people with small problems.,rotten
Waiting to Exhale,A pleasant if undemanding piece of work that is diverting to sit through though it won't stand up to any kind of rigorous examination.,fresh
Waiting to Exhale,"You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again.",rotten
Waiting to Exhale,This sister-celebratory adaptation of Terry McMillan's best-selling book is frequently delightful.,fresh
Waiting to Exhale,"The male-bashing taken to an extreme in Waiting to Exhale is starting to seem a little like crack for the female psyche, exhilarating in the short term but ultimately crippling and dangerous.",rotten
Waiting to Exhale,"Whitaker clumsily mishandles what should be a 'you go, girl!' tour de force.",fresh
Waiting to Exhale,"For all the pleasure there is in seeing effective, great-looking black women grappling with major life issues on screen, Waiting to Exhale is an uneven piece.",rotten
Waiting to Exhale,"With the exception of Bernadine, I never felt anything for the women populating this film, as they failed to capture my interest or sympathy.",rotten
Waiting to Exhale,"An escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, 'I wish I had her problems' - and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.",fresh
Father of the Bride Part II,"Martin, Keaton and cinematographer William A. Fraker put this retro fluff over better than expected early on, but hour 2 is only for those who don't want their equilibriums rattled by surprises.",rotten
Heat,"When Pacino's loud, bruised cop and De Niro's canny crook stare at each other, you can read something spent and weary in their eyes and voices. The heat is hell. So are their jobs -- but somebody's got to do them.",fresh
Heat,"The taciturn De Niro and the braying Pacino share a flawless scene over a cup of coffee, but the real honors go to Val Kilmer and Ashley Judd as a warring, loving couple.",fresh
Heat,"So why doesn't Heat, with its elaborately staged, tautly edited robberies, its killer cast, edgy score and elegant cinematography, offer more satisfaction? It's the script, stupid.",rotten
Heat,"Just when it seemed that the only hope for crime movies lay in the postmodernist artifice of films like Pulp Fiction, Mann reinvests the genre with brooding, modernist conviction. This one sticks to your gut.",rotten
Heat,"There's nothing really new in this lengthy 1995 thriller by writer-director Michael Mann about cops and robbers in Los Angeles, but it has craft, pacing, and an overall sense of proportion, three pretty rare classic virtues nowadays.",fresh
Heat,"An odd though often entertaining blend of The Asphalt Jungle and Oprah, a traditional cops-and-robbers story weirdly fitted out with long, earnest discussions of interpersonal relationships.",fresh
Heat,"There isn't much going on at this party other than what the actors bring to it. But fortunately, Mann has invited some exceptional ones.",fresh
Heat,Heat becomes consistently more interesting as it forges on toward the 180-minute mark.,fresh
Heat,Heat occupies an exalted position among the countless contemporary crime films.,fresh
Heat,Robert De Niro's last great role before he devoted himself to self-parody.,fresh
Heat,"This is simply the best American crime movie -- and indeed, one of the finest movies, period -- in over a decade.",fresh
Heat,"As Heat progresses, its sensational looks pale beside storytelling weaknesses that expose the more soulless aspects of this cat-and-mouse crime tale.",rotten
Heat,"Michael Mann and a superlative cast have taken a classic heist movie rife with familiar genre elements and turned it into a sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving.",fresh
Heat,"All the squealing tires, flying bullets and falling bodies cannot save Heat from drowning in its own banalities.",rotten
Heat,Michael Mann's writing and direction elevate this material. It's not just an action picture.,fresh
Heat,... a colossal disappointment.,rotten
Heat,Heat generates lots of energy but gives off little light.,fresh
Heat,Boosters and touts use the term 'major movie' so often that it's more likely to generate yawns than excitement at this point. Back to basics. Heat is a major movie. With major stars. Doing major acting.,fresh
Heat,"This is the first time De Niro and Pacino have acted together, and each gives a strong, watertight performance.",fresh
Heat,The cop/ crime stuff that makes up the bulk of the movie is well thought out and well directed.,fresh
Sabrina,"This is never less than glittering entertainment, but somehow a certain measure of lead has found its way into the formula.",fresh
Sabrina,"Script is long on glibly quipping dialog, dropped with a seemingly casual air, and broadly played situations. The splendid trouping delivers them style. Leavening the chuckles are tugs at the heart.",fresh
Sabrina,Wilder's tastelessness now seems his major artistic strength.,fresh
Sabrina,"It's a Cinderella story that gets turned on its head, a satire about breaking down class and emotional barriers, and a confrontation between New World callousness and Old World humanity.",fresh
Sabrina,"Hampered by an unimaginative script ... nevertheless manages to be a thoroughly charming, delightfully romantic variation of the Cinderella story.",fresh
Sabrina,"It is a story as light as a feather and as old as yesterday's news, as transparent as a society column item and as smug as a foreign-made car. But Mr. Wilder...has made it into a commentary as crisp as a screed in a smart magazine.",fresh
Tom and Huck,A joyless lump.,rotten
Sudden Death,"Reuniting Hyams and Van Damme, director and star of Timecop, this spectacular nail-biter exploits their combined, if limited, abilities to the full.",fresh
Sudden Death,"Offers above-average pyrotechnics, a body count that steadily mounts, and plenty of hand-to-hand combat.",fresh
Sudden Death,Sudden Death is one of the best action thrillers of 1995. It's also the film Jean-Claude Van Damme has been building up to for 10 years.,fresh
Sudden Death,"Despite the elaborate stunts, go-go-go direction from Peter Hyams, plus butt-kicking and surprise goalie action from Van Damme, Death deserves the hockey-puck booby prize for...getting its jollies by putting kids in jeopardy.",rotten
Sudden Death,"A treat for Jean-Claude Van Damme fans, a superior action thriller loaded with jaw-dropping stunts and special effects, and strong in production values.",fresh
Sudden Death,"Sudden Death isn't about common sense. It's about the manipulation of action and special-effects sequences to create a thriller effect, and at that it's pretty good.",fresh
Sudden Death,"Though the climactic duel atop the arena roof is patently absurd, it's also exciting as events go into sudden-death overtime, just like the game being played below.",fresh
Sudden Death,"Van Damme races against time, trying to thwart Boothe and defuse all the bombs. But in the hands of director Peter Hyams, these are just banal action-movie chores.",rotten
Sudden Death,"About the best thing that can be said about this movie is that the action scenes, directed by Peter Hyams, are choreographed with flair. Unfortunately, the material connecting them is worthless.",rotten
GoldenEye,"Brosnan, however, looks set to stay. He'll never recapture the amused cool of the young Sean Connery, but he does overcome the handicap of looking like a humorless male model.",fresh
GoldenEye,"I don't know whether the Bond series has a future, but if Xenia Onatopp ever returns to try for world domination, he may finally get a battle worth fighting.",rotten
GoldenEye,"There's something a mite pathetic about our culture still clinging to 007, but it's hard to deny that this is one of the most entertaining entries in the Bond cycle.",fresh
GoldenEye,"Richard Kiel, you are missed.",rotten
GoldenEye,"Among the better of the 17 Bonds and, perhaps more important for today's audience, a dynamic action entry in its own right, this first 007 adventure in six years breathes fresh creative and commercial life into the 33-year-old series.",fresh
GoldenEye,Director Campbell keeps matters bowling along and even manages to recapture something of the look of the earlier films.,fresh
GoldenEye,Suffers the blahs.,rotten
GoldenEye,"Supercharged with spectacular, thundering, brain-numbing fun.",fresh
GoldenEye,"They have given James a new car here, but it's the same old vanity plate, the one that should read: Je Me Souviens.",rotten
GoldenEye,"A reasonable facsimile more than any kind of original, and it's hard not to feel a certain weariness while watching it unfold.",rotten
GoldenEye,It's BS -- Babes and Stunts -- and that's where GoldenEye excels.,fresh
GoldenEye,Directed with top-dollar proficiency (and some real wit).,fresh
GoldenEye,Perhaps the best entry in the series since The Spy Who Loved Me.,fresh
GoldenEye,"Watching the film, I got caught up in the special effects and the neat stunts, and I observed with a certain satisfaction Bond's belated entry into a more modern world.",fresh
The American President,"Part romantic comedy, part Capra-corny political drama, this movie exudes so much sympathy, it sweats.",fresh
The American President,"With great looks, a dandy supporting cast, a zinger-filled screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Mr. Douglas twinkling merrily in the Oval Office, The American President is sunny enough to make the real Presidency pale by comparison.",fresh
The American President,Genial and entertaining if not notably inspired.,fresh
The American President,Genial middlebrow fare that coasts a long way on the charm of its two stars.,fresh
The American President,As bustling and impassioned as the best Sturges and Capra movies.,fresh
The American President,"Neither bad nor unwatchable, The American President is nevertheless the second straight disappointment from director Rob Reiner.",rotten
The American President,"You can't dislike this movie, but you won't be swept away by it either.",fresh
The American President,The American President will make you laugh and make you smile. But it probably won't make you change your vote.,fresh
The American President,"Apart from its too-obvious political bias, The American President has romance in its heart, smarts in abundance and class to spare.",fresh
The American President,Great entertainment.,fresh
The American President,A well-modulated charmer.,fresh
The American President,The American President becomes a pretty darn entertaining and affecting movie after its first simpering 20 minutes.,fresh
The American President,Frothy.,fresh
The American President,"'Capraesque' has inevitably been affixed to The American President, but that phrase, with its implications of facile hokum, doesn't do the film justice.",fresh
The American President,Painless fun.,fresh
The American President,A super cast injects it with Teddy Roosevelt vitality.,fresh
The American President,"When it comes right down to it, high office does not guarantee high comedy.",rotten
The American President,"The image of a chief executive as moonstruck single guy taps something buoyant and touching in our collective democratic imagination. And Douglas, wearing a fast-break smile in place of his usual frown, strikes a tender rapport with Bening...",fresh
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Either this is the lamest Mel Brooks comedy ever or it's too close to other contenders to make much difference.,rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"The only real sparks are set off by MacNicol as Renfield, the solicitor who develops a taste for flies and spiders after being bitten by Dracula.",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Brooks, as Van Helsing, is one of the more successful aspects, but he hasn't imbued in his stock company a similar ability to rise above their underwritten roles.",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,Slight but amusing.,fresh
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Not to venture forth some sort of radical idea, but aren't comedies supposed to have jokes?",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,It's a toothless parody that misses more often than it hits.,rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"This time, unfortunately, he's sucking on a dry vein.",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"If any movie proves that Mel Brooks' genius for skewering creaky genres has evaporated, it's this anemic attempt to draw new blood from low-flying vampire high jinks.",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Dracula is anemic and mediocre, with only one or two moments to remind you of the former, funnier Brooks.",rotten
Dracula: Dead and Loving It,"Nielsen makes a dapper and calmly inept Dracula, but it's Brooks' irrepressible and oblivious Van Helsing who's the main attraction.",fresh
Balto,"The love story is pure mush, not helped by the bland voice work done by Kevin Bacon as Balto and Bridget Fonda as dainty husky Jenna.",rotten
Nixon,"As wayward and self-regarding as its subject, the film long overstays its welcome.",rotten
Nixon,"What it finally adds up to is a huge mixed bag of waxworks and daring, a film that is furiously ambitious even when it goes flat, and startling even when it settles for eerie, movie-of-the-week mimicry.",fresh
Nixon,"Without question, Nixon dwarfs everything in the American cinema since Schindler's List.",fresh
Nixon,"Nixon starts, like a horror movie, on a dark and stormy night, with the president prowling around a room of the White House like Dracula in his lair.",fresh
Nixon,Nixon far overstays its welcome with an increasingly tedious final hour devoted largely to slogging through the minutiae of Watergate.,rotten
Nixon,"Factual or not, there's no denying that Nixon has moments when it is nothing short of compelling.",fresh
Nixon,There's no compelling structure or viewpoint to hold the picture together.,rotten
Nixon,The problem here isn't accuracy. It's absurdity.,rotten
Nixon,"Thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind; here, again, is a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws. There's something almost majestic about the process: As Nixon goes down in this film, there is no gloating, but a watery sigh, as of a great ship",fresh
Nixon,"Thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated, the film also marks director Oliver Stone's coming of age.",fresh
Nixon,You will not be bored.,fresh
Nixon,The picture is a case study.,fresh
Nixon,Casting Anthony Hopkins was a stroke of unexpected genius.,fresh
Nixon,"Stone's no Shakespeare, and neither are his screenwriters.",rotten
Nixon,Joan Allen goes beyond her chilling physical resemblance to Pat Nixon toward serious Oscar worthiness.,fresh
Nixon,I never felt that I was seeing the darkness reaching out to the darkness as Nixon was once described.,rotten
Nixon,"Real life, if it's real Nixon, is more dramatic than an Oliver Stone movie.",rotten
Cutthroat Island,"What seemed like a dubious proposition on paper plays even more dubiously onscreen, as ""Cutthroat Island"" strenuously but vainly attempts to revive the thrills of old-fashioned pirate pictures.",rotten
Cutthroat Island,"In this $90m revisionist swashbuckler, we get Geena Davis doing the all-action honours, and a hotchpotch script that seems to think pirate movies are so funny in themselves the need for more humour is superfluous.",rotten
Cutthroat Island,"t's not possible to believe that Ms. Davis is the highly respected captain of a pirate ship, and it's not even fun to try.",rotten
Cutthroat Island,"If the sight of half-naked, tattooed sailors firing cannons at each other shivers your timbers, climb aboard. Even passable pirate movies don't sail by every day.",fresh
Cutthroat Island,It takes a two-hour act of will to keep facing the screen during this moribund movie.,rotten
Casino,"[Stone] seems to be trying to enter a more passionate movie, where a neurotic gold digger could at least have a good time. By the end of Casino, for all its craftsmanly bravura, you may want to join her.",fresh
Casino,"So long as Casino stays focused on the excesses -- of language, of violence, of ambition -- in the life-styles of the rich and infamous, it remains a smart, knowing, if often repetitive, spectacle.",fresh
Casino,Simultaneously quite watchable and passionless.,rotten
Casino,"Martin Scorsese's intimate epic about money, sex and brute force is a grandly conceived study of what happens to goodfellas from the mean streets when they outstrip their wildest dreams and achieve the pinnacle of wealth and power.",fresh
Casino,"It's not the actors' fault that no one is able to break through the film's gorgeous but chilly surface. You watch Casino with respect and appreciation, reveling in its documentary sense of detail.",rotten
Casino,"Scorsese may be flailing here, but Scorsese flailing is more formidable than most directors at the top of their form.",rotten
Casino,"The result, sadly, is that contradiction in terms, a dull Scorsese movie.",rotten
Casino,"Of all the bravura visual effects in Martin Scorsese's dazzlingly stylish Casino, it's a glimpse of ordinary people that delivers the greatest jolt.",fresh
Casino,"It's an ambitious film, but also a scattered, unfocused one.",rotten
Casino,"Visually impressive, splendidly performed, thematically significant, this is a movie in full possession of every key cinematic asset except one -- a solid script.",fresh
Casino,[A] Vegas masterpiece.,fresh
Casino,"Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker, so skilled in the manipulation of imagery he might be the most proficient of active American directors.",fresh
Casino,"After coming out gangbusters in its first and finest hour, the 180-minute movie loses all its chips in the remaining two.",rotten
Casino,Martin Scorsese's fascinating new film Casino knows a lot about the Mafia's relationship with Las Vegas.,fresh
Casino,"In every way -- from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well-portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal -- Casino is pure Scorsese.",fresh
Casino,"Whether you find it exhilarating, expendable or exhausting -- and you will find it exhausting -- Martin Scorsese's Casino is the spectacular last word on urban sprawl.",fresh
Sense and Sensibility,Thompson's script manages the neat trick of preserving the necessary niceties and decorum of civilized behavior of the time while still cutting to the dramatic quick.,fresh
Sense and Sensibility,I can't say I remembered this 1995 feature too clearly a couple of days later; but I certainly had a good time as I watched it.,fresh
Sense and Sensibility,Thompson and Winslet give fine performances ably supported by the rest of the ensemble.,fresh
Sense and Sensibility,We need no further proof that this material is ageless.,fresh
Sense and Sensibility,"The sensibility may be a bit off, but there is more than enough sense involved in this mid-Atlantic Austen to make up the difference.",fresh

Sense and Sensibility,Demonstrates how little humankind has evolved in matters of the heart.,none
Sense and Sensibility,"An exuberant, well- crafted film that gets the audience involved on a gut level.",fresh
Four Rooms,"The results are mainly awful, and even Roth got saddled with a mannered part that he can't comfortably play.",rotten
Four Rooms,"Four of the hottest indie directors--Anders, Rockwell, Tarantino, and Rodrigues--miss a unique opportunity to display their idiosyncratic talents resulting in a tedious anthology in which 2 segments are inept, one barely decent, and one OK (guess whose)",rotten
Four Rooms,They should have called this One Room and released it as a Rodriguez short.,rotten
Four Rooms,"The less said about this career-denting fiasco, the better.",rotten
Four Rooms,Sounds better than it is.,rotten
Four Rooms,"Four Rooms has been cut substantially since a disastrous September reception at the Toronto Film Festival, though it's hard to imagine it running any longer.",rotten
Four Rooms,"The four segments are widely different in quality. On the useful scale of the Michelin guides, one is worth a trip, another is worth a detour, and the other two are a colossal waste of bandwidth.",rotten
Four Rooms,Four Rooms asserts itself as a goof so laboriously and aggressively that you almost feel pinned back in your seat.,rotten
Four Rooms,"The result is a batch of shrill, self-indulgent sketches that turn so wretched in spots you start to wonder if the filmmakers wanted them to be bad.",rotten
Four Rooms,The segments are uniformly weak.,rotten
Four Rooms,Four Rooms has to be one of 1995's major disappointments.,rotten
Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,"There's so little to watch besides Carrey, in fact, it makes you actually miss (gasp!) Sean Young from Ace 1.",rotten
Money Train,Bounces along with a lame script and inconsistent pace.,rotten
Money Train,Hardly worth the four-year wait.,rotten
Money Train,"More viscerally charged than ""Speed"" and hipper than ""Die Hard With a Vengeance,"" the movie is a careening, screeching joyride that showers sparks like fireworks.",fresh
Money Train,"""Money Train"" is a by-the-numbers action-buddy picture, and few directors run through those numbers as smoothly as Joseph Ruben.",fresh
Money Train,"Even if they only charged a token, it would be too much.",rotten
Money Train,"It's stupid, but also breezier than the year's other 12-score releases not worth a second look.",rotten

Get Shorty,"Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies. But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.",fresh
Get Shorty,A drolly offbeat look at Hollywood mores dedicated to the proposition that the best preparation for becoming a film producer is a stint in the criminal underworld.,fresh
Get Shorty,An entertaining comedy-thriller adapted by Scott Frank from the Elmore Leonard best-seller and directed with bounce (if not much nuance) by Barry Sonnenfeld.,fresh
Get Shorty,Everything clicks.,fresh
Get Shorty,"It's part of the joke here that Chili is a die-hard cineaste and loves reminiscing about smart, stylish tough-guy films he has enjoyed. Get Shorty belongs on that list.",fresh
Get Shorty,"It's Travolta -- smooth, commanding, handsome as ever, a cool, rhythmic bop in his walk -- who owns the film.",fresh
Get Shorty,The result is one of the best movies of the year and by far the most entertaining.,fresh
Get Shorty,In the category of amiable diversions it's awfully tough to improve on.,fresh
Get Shorty,Irresistibly charming.,fresh
Get Shorty,"Minor, but amusingly droll.",fresh
Get Shorty,"One of the pleasures of Get Shorty is watching the way the plot moves effortlessly from crime to the movies - not a long distance, since both industries are based on fear, greed, creativity and intimidation.",fresh
Get Shorty,"This comic potboiler about gangsters in Hollywood would be a great piece of fun even without Travolta. But as a loan shark from Miami with a charming bedside manner and bigtime movie dreams, he raises the fun quotient into the sublime.",fresh
Get Shorty,"While it's quite possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film, this is a real treat for movie buffs. The story is as much about the love of motion pictures as it is about gangsters.",fresh
Copycat,"Copycat, despite two tough-babe leads to kill for, flies in more directions than scattered kitty litter.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,A garish and poorly filmed chop-socky frolic that makes about as much sense as an Escher painting viewed through Vaseline-smudged Ray-Bans.,rotten
Ninja Assassin,Perhaps such phenomenal slaughter is best left to the imagination.,rotten
Ninja Assassin,"The problem is that the fight sequences -- the only reason anyone sees a movie like this in the first place -- are muddy, chaotic and boring. Even diehard fans of this genre would be well advised to skip this one.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"This saga, set in Berlin, is more committed to its bloodletting than to any of its characters.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,A movie that provides plenty of jolts but precious little pleasure.,rotten
Ninja Assassin,This movie knows exactly what it is: Gonzo silliness about bodies turned into human salsa.,fresh
Ninja Assassin,"Shouldn't throwing stars be silent? If they're gonna sound like gunshots, why not just use guns?",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"It's a gorefest, a borefest and a snorefest.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"Thanks to the movie's dire script, flat performances and excessively slick, tricked-out fight scenes, it gets increasingly hard to care about anything that goes on here, even when it happens to be visible without the use of night-vision goggles.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"This one is simply a diverting, uncommonly violent action flick. No need for an extended critical postmortem. Except to say the Wachowski brothers' trademark seems to have turned into a designer brand dedicated to producing inexpensive knockoffs.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"Rain is a very talented slaughterer. He could kill you with a pair of tweezers, a hair dryer, two bananas, whatever. Be glad he's a good ninja.",fresh

Ninja Assassin,"Heads may roll, torsos get severed and geysers of blood spurt, but no amount of CGI'd gore can save 'Assassin' from being dramatically lame, visually impaired and kinetically flat-footed.",rotten
Ninja Assassin,The credits for Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But it's fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box.,rotten
Ninja Assassin,"This amateurish action flick is so lacking in personality or punch, it ought to be titled ""V for Video Store Discount Bin.""",rotten
Ninja Assassin,"Let's be honest, killing is this film's business... and business is good.",fresh
Ninja Assassin,"McTeigue can barely shoot straight, and the editing is so hack-y, you have to take the stunts and fight choreography on faith.",rotten

Leaving Las Vegas,"Dark and giddy at the same time, Leaving Las Vegas takes us into dreamy, intoxicated places no movie about an alcoholic has gone before.",fresh
Leaving Las Vegas,"We're not talking high, morally instructive tragedy here, just a hard lesson in postmodernist outlawry and its sad little anarchies.",fresh
Leaving Las Vegas,"The film pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.",fresh

Othello,Parker has shown how involving and moving Shakespeare can still be on the screen.,fresh
Othello,"Parker, whose screenplay strips down the original play, merely produces a lackluster essence.",rotten
Othello,"For sheer impact, this Othello can stand side-by-side with the versions brought to the screen by Orson Welles (as restored in 1992) and Lawrence Olivier.",fresh
Othello,"The movie is roughly on the same cinematic level as the Mel Gibson Hamlet, though it tends to get under your skin a little more once it gets rolling.",fresh
Othello,"... Will not give its viewers much of an idea of the Shakespeare play, and may inadvertently give them other ideas, about interracial love, that were not much on Shakespeare's mind.",rotten
Othello,"Passion, like outpourings of iambic pentameter, isn't part of this picture's equation.",rotten

Persuasion,Austen fans: Prepare to be swept away.,fresh
Persuasion,"Persuasion is Jane without pain, E-Z Austen. It's a delight.",fresh

2 Days in Paris,It's possible to watch 2 Days in Paris and have absolutely no idea who's calling the shots. This is excellent news because it means that we gain a director without losing an actress.,fresh
2 Days in Paris,"Satirical and casual in its approach, and Delpy's grasp of the material is assured.",fresh

The Wild Bunch,"In purely cinematic terms, the film is a savagely beautiful spectacle, Lucien Ballard's superb cinematography complementing Peckinpah's darkly elegiac vision.",fresh
The Wild Bunch,"The Wild Bunch takes the basic elements of the Western movie myth, which once defined a simple, morally comprehensible world, and by bending them turns them into symbols of futility and aimless corruption.",fresh

Fargo,"Has a murder mystery, a heist gone wrong, tragedy, comedy, and well flushed out characters that are both simple and complex at the same time.",fresh
Fargo,"Fargo has been hauntingly photographed by Roger Deakins with great, expressive use of white-outs that sometimes make the characters appear to be moving through a dream.",fresh
Fargo,"Whether these characters are lovable or detestable, they're lovable or detestable in a TV way -- defined by a minimal set of traits that are endlessly reiterated and incapable of expansion or alteration, a fixed loop.",rotten
Fargo,"Kidnapping, larceny and murder have seldom been funnier than in Fargo.",fresh

A Thin Line Between Love and Hate,"A Thin Line Between Love and Hate takes its name from the Persuaders 1971 hit that has been re-recorded by the Pretenders, Annie Lennox and H-Town. You could have just as much fun simply playing one of them and skipping the movie.",rotten
Primal Fear,"As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job.",fresh
Carried Away,"Tries to incorporate almost film-noir elements into a heartland love story. The blending feels inorganic; and composer Bruce Broughton doesn't help matters by coating every moment with a repetitive, syrupy theme.",rotten

Carried Away,"Carried Away is erotic, but it's also thoughtful and intelligent, and, coupled with Hopper's extraordinary performance, that's reason enough to be carried away by this motion picture.",fresh

Basic Instinct,"This erotically charged thriller about the search for an ice-pick murderer in San Francisco rivets attention through its sleek style, attractive cast doing and thinking kinky things, and story, which is as weirdly implausible as it is intensely visceral.",fresh
Basic Instinct,"Douglas and Stone are superb, and George Dzundza (as sidekick Gus) delivers another classic hard-boiled cameo.",fresh

Goodfellas,"Spanning thirty years and running two and a half hours, the film bristles with the violent passion, howitzer wit and virtuoso style that made Scorsese's reputation with the gangster drama Mean Streets in 1973.",fresh

Goodfellas,"Robert De Niro gives what has come to be a typical Robert De Niro performance -- understated, sly, ingratiating. Joe Pesci, as the hot-tempered Tommy, steals several scenes from his fellow performers.",fresh
Goodfellas,"The most profoundly Catholic of contemporary filmmakers, Scorsese has here imagined a world without the slightest notion of sin-everything is permitted, and he is both fascinated and appalled by the total freedom of his characters.",fresh

Ran,"By the time Kurosawa's camera comes to rest on the film's final, poignant image, a painting of the Buddha that one character had promised another would protect him from harm, the movie seemingly has accomplished the impossible: one-upping Shakespeare.",fresh
Ran,"There's probably more carnage in Ran than there is in Rambo and The Terminator combined, but the new film substitutes intelligence and emotion for mindlessness and emotionalism. You leave the theater awestruck, not dumbstruck.",fresh
Ran,"What could be more exciting than the prospect of one of the giants of world cinema, his career resuscitated, adapting Shakespeare's most modern play?",fresh
Ran,"What's remarkable about Ran is that the drama enhances the spectacle the same way the spectacle bolsters the drama. Few other directors had Kurosawa's ability to convey the intimate as well as the epic, to handle stillness as well as violence.",fresh
Ran,Those who were suspicious of the filmmaker's unambiguous plotting and Westernized approach had to admit to its daunting grandeur.,fresh

Ran,"At age 75, the director has made his most costly epic to date, and it's a dazzlingly successful addition to his distinguished career.",fresh
Ran,"Akira Kurosawa's 1985 film is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema.",fresh

Ran,"Kurosawa dares to edit Shakespeare's story lines, adding back stories and deleting major characters, but the motivations and emotions remain true.",fresh
Ran,"A film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance and Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.",fresh

Psycho,The best that can be said is there are bats in the belfry and a well-preserved corpse in the basement. What else can one do but scream?,fresh
Psycho,"It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle, but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation.",fresh
Psycho,"Director Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one, and the delicate illusion of reality necessary for a creak-and-shriek movie becomes, instead, a spectacle of stomach-churning horror.",rotten
Psycho,"An unusual, good entertainment, indelibly Hitchcock, and on the right kind of boxoffice beam.",fresh
Psycho,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.",fresh
Psycho,"All those who still get a chill every time they step into a hotel shower, say aye. That, you see, is the power of Psycho.",fresh
Psycho,"What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater, is that it connects directly with our fears.",fresh
Psycho,"[Hitchcock] has very shrewdly interwoven crime, sex and suspense, blended the real and the unreal in fascinating proportions and punctuated his film with several quick, grisly and unnerving surprises.",fresh
Psycho,"With the exception of Halloween, no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps.",fresh
Psycho,[Hitchcock's] denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair.,fresh

The Godfather: Part II,"The stunning text of The Godfather is replaced in Part II with prologues, epilogues, footnotes, and good intentions.",fresh
The Godfather: Part II,It's a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzo's novel that didn't fit into the first. It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own.,rotten
The Godfather: Part II,Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one.,fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"If his considerable achievement in this long- awaited film falls short of his Olympian standards, there is a reason that ought to give Kubrick some satisfaction. The world has caught up with Kubrick and what he has to say.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"It may seem too spare, too clinical, its moments of war even too familiar for some. But, aiming for minds as well as hearts, Kubrick hits his target squarely.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"What gives this story its power is not really its originality, but the relentlessness of Kubrick's black-comic vision and the tightness of his focus.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"There is a real fear at the heart of this monstrously armored, desperately defensive film.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"It's a great piece of filmmaking, diminished only by a second act that fails to live up to the first act of the Marines in training.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"Full Metal Jacket is not a realistic film -- it is horror-comic superrealism, from a God's-eye view -- but it should fully engage the ordinary movie grunt.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"This is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since Dr. Strangelove, as well as the most horrific; the first section alone accomplishes most of what The Shining failed to do.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"An intense, schematic, superbly made Vietnam War drama.",fresh
Full Metal Jacket,"Kubrick's direction is as steely cold and manipulative as the regime it depicts, and we never really get to know, let alone care about, the hapless recruits on view.",rotten
Full Metal Jacket,"Although the elements of the story are simple and precise, Kubrick infuses a dreamlike, fatalistic quality.",fresh

Henry V,Everything about this remarkable production is exhilaratingly unexpected.,fresh
Henry V,What works best in the film is the over-all vision.,fresh

Amadeus,"This dark, exuberant epic is nearly 18 years old, yet remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.",fresh

The Quiet Man,This is a robust romantic drama of a native-born's return to Ireland. Director John Ford took cast and cameras to Ireland to tell the story [by Maurice Walsh] against actual backgrounds.,fresh
The Quiet Man,John Ford's 1952 Oscar winner is a tribute to an Ireland that exists only in the imaginations of songwriters and poets like Ford.,fresh
The Quiet Man,The illusion/reality theme underlying immigrant boxer Wayne's return from America to County Galway is soon swamped within a vibrant community of stage-Irish 'types'.,rotten
The Quiet Man,"Let's face it. Mr. Ford is in love with Ireland, as is his cast, and they give us a fine, gay time while they're about it.",fresh
The Quiet Man,"Although not a true classic, The Quiet Man is worth more than a cursory glance, especially for those who like Wayne or would like to experience more of his work.",fresh
Once Upon a Time in America,"Sergio Leone's languid, lovely and lengthy ode to Lower East Side mobsters (more specifically, mobster films) ...",fresh
Once Upon a Time in America,"Leone is less interested in arousing an audience's easier emotions than in presenting, at a dispassionate distance, the horror of two men warily walking toward each other on a tightrope suspended above the snake pit of their , deepest compulsions.",fresh
Once Upon a Time in America,"Every gesture is immediate, and every gesture seems eternal.",fresh
Once Upon a Time in America,A disappointment of considerable proportions.,rotten
Once Upon a Time in America,"While Leone's vision still has a magnificent sweep, the film finally subsides to an emotional core that is sombre, even elegiac, and which centres on a man who is bent and broken by time, and finally left with nothing but an impotent sadness.",rotten

Once Upon a Time in America,A lazily haullucinatory epic that means to encapsulate approximately 50 years of American social history into a single film.,rotten

Raging Bull,The film that many consider the finest of its decade.,fresh
Raging Bull,An underdog in its day and a classic today.,fresh
Raging Bull,"Though Raging Bull has only three principal characters, it is a big film, its territory being the landscape of the soul.",fresh
Raging Bull,"The most obvious basis for the film's claim to greatness lies in Scorsese's devastating critique of the very codes of masculinity that shaped him as a filmmaker, and in Robert De Niro's performance, through which that critique is made flesh.",fresh
Raging Bull,"It's the best film I've seen about the low self-esteem, sexual inadequacy and fear that lead some men to abuse women.",fresh
Raging Bull,"There's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas. During fight sequences, the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world, however briefly, from La Motta's perspective.",fresh
Annie Hall,"Allen joins the Catskills tummler's anything-for-a-laugh antics with a Eurocentric art-house self-awareness and a psychoanalytic obsession in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions.",fresh

Annie Hall,"Personal as the story he is telling may be, what separates this film from Allen's own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability.",fresh
Annie Hall,A touching and hilarious love story that is Allen's most three-dimensional film to date.,fresh
Annie Hall,"Visually and structurally it's a mess, but many of the situations are genuinely clever, and there are plenty of memorable gags.",fresh
Annie Hall,"If you can forgive the fact that it's a ragbag of half-digested intellectual ideas dressed up with trendy intellectual references, you should have a good laugh.",fresh
Annie Hall,"There will be discussion about what points in the film coincide with the lives of its two stars, but this, I think, is to detract from and trivialize the achievement of the film, which, at last, puts Woody in the league with the best directors we have.",fresh

Das Boot,You're drawn in powerfully as the crew members experience a psychologically maddening cycle of lull and storm.,fresh
Das Boot,"Suspenseful when it needs to be and intelligent in its depiction of the horrors of war and the sweaty claustrophobia of submarine life. On occasion, it's even -- pardon the pun -- deep.",fresh

The Sting,"The movie has a nice, light-fingered style to it.",fresh
Harold and Maude,"The fact that [it] isn't very funny and, like its 80-year-old heroic, long outlives its necessary life, is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the script's impossible notions.",fresh

Trust the Man,"Freundlich's outstanding cast (including Garry Shandling, Eva Mendes, Ellen Barkin, Bob Balaban and James LeGros) -- his best since 1997's The Myth of Fingerprints -- glosses over miscalculations with sheer star power.",fresh
Trust the Man,"Two couples in trouble, one with kids, another considering them. Writer-director Bart Freundlich's challenge is to stress them and find a resolution to their conflicts in ways that aren't banal, predictable or witless. And he settles for one out of three.",rotten
Trust the Man,"The fact that Freundlich tries to put some thoughtful commentary into a formulaic story is commendable, but in the end either his faith wavers or the studio intervened.",rotten
Trust the Man,"I wish the film were true to itself and its quartet of puzzled, struggling lovers; their collapse into sitcom idiocy felt uncomfortably close to betrayal.",rotten

Trust the Man,"Trust the Man has a sketchy overall feel, as if Freundlich didn't finish thinking it through.",rotten
Trust the Man,"Trust the Man is a mildly amusing movie, but that's chiefly a result of its stars -- or, more specifically, its female stars -- elevating the material.",rotten
Trust the Man,"As faux Woody Allen movies go, Trust the Man is one of the more diverting recent entries in the genre, with a top-drawer cast, well-chosen Manhattan locations and a sharper script than Allen himself has managed in a while.",fresh

Terminator Salvation,"The latest installment in the venerable sci-fi action franchise turns out to be a straight-up war film, grim and muscular and thundering and joyless. It's the color of cement, and it weighs as much, too.",rotten

Braindead,The best to date from Kiwi gore specialist Peter Jackson.,fresh
Braindead,"The finale, in which Lionel reduces a horde of flesh-eaters to a mulch of blood, flesh and offal with the aid of a flymo, is probably the goriest scene ever.",fresh
Braindead,"Because all of this looks blatantly unreal, and because the timing of the shock effects is so haphazard, Dead Alive isn't especially scary or repulsive. Nor is it very funny.",rotten
Braindead,"Horror films used to be primordial spook shows, tapping midnight-dark fears. Now they tap bodily goo: rivers of blood, dripping limbs, eyeballs that go pop in the night.",fresh

Manhattan,"The film should not come as a complete surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Allen's doings lately. This is the movie that Annie Hall hinted at and to which last year's Interiors, flawed as it was, seems to have served as a necessary prelude.",fresh
Manhattan,"Allen serves up a nostalgia that was utterly of its time; he incarnates an idea of the city that, even now, remains as strong as its reality and refracts his disappointed ideals into high existential crises.",fresh
Manhattan,"Manhattan is not just Woody Allen's dream movie. Wistful as it is witty, it's his dream of the movies.",fresh
Manhattan,"Allen has, in black and white, captured the inner beauty that lurks behind the outer layer of dirt and grime in Manhattan.",fresh
Manhattan,Woody Allen's great leap forward into character development and dramatic integrity.,fresh
Manhattan,"This is a deeply self-critical film about immaturity and the gift of real love. Many films can be said to put an epitaph on the decade, but few remain as relevant.",fresh
Manhattan,Woody Allen's gem of comic kvetching.,fresh
Manhattan,Mr. Allen's progress as one of our major filmmakers is proceeding so rapidly that we who watch him have to pause occasionally to catch our breath.,fresh
Manhattan,"If Manhattan was only a romantic comedy, it would be a very good one, but the fact that the movie has so much more ambition than the 'average' entry into the genre makes it an extraordinary example of the fusion of entertainment and art.",fresh
Manhattan,"Seeing it again I realize it's more subtle, more complex, and not about love, but loss.",fresh

Dead Poets Society,"Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.",fresh
Dead Poets Society,"Story sings whenever Williams is onscreen. Screen belongs just as often to Leonard, who as Neil has a quality of darting confidence mixed with hesitancy. Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.",fresh
Dead Poets Society,"The moral divisions set up between characters are childishly overdrawn; and, worst of all, the behavior shown by the boys and adults frequently reeks of falsity and contrivance.",rotten
Dead Poets Society,"Weir infuses the film with his customary mysticism, but more importantly, draws sensitive performances from his largely inexperienced cast.",fresh
Dead Poets Society,"The movie undercuts Mr. Williams's exceptionally fine performance, making the character seem more of a dubious fool than is probably intended.",rotten
Dead Poets Society,"It's a literate though strained uplifter, a not altogether compatible coupleting of Rocky Balboa and the Bard.",fresh
Dead Poets Society,"Not the worst of the countless recent movies about good kids and hidebound, authoritatian older people. It may, however, be the most shameless in its attempt to pander to an adolescent audience.",rotten

The Graduate,"The emotional elevation of the film is due in no small measure to the extraordinarily engaging performances of Anne Bancroft as the wife-mother-mistress, Dustin Hoffman as the lumbering Lancelot, and Katherine Ross as his fair Elaine.",fresh
The Graduate,"It's consistently fleet and funny, even as it probes the heady abandon and looming hangover that typified the decade of discontent.",fresh
The Graduate,"The screenplay, which begins as genuine comedy, soon degenerates into spurious melodrama.",rotten
The Graduate,"The film itself is very broken-backed, partly because Anne Bancroft's performance as the mother carries so much more weight than Katharine Ross' as the daughter, partly because Nichols couldn't decide whether he was making a social satire or a farce.",rotten

The Bridge on the River Kwai,"It is a whale of a story, and in the telling of it, British Director David Lean does a whale of a job.",fresh
The Bridge on the River Kwai,"A gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.",fresh
The Bridge on the River Kwai,"For what it is, it ain't bad, though it serves mainly as an illustration of the ancient quandary of revisionist moviemakers: if all you do is systematically invert cliches, you simply end up creating new ones.",rotten

The Bridge on the River Kwai,"Brilliant is the word, and no other, to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.",fresh
The Bridge on the River Kwai,Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals.,fresh
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"Treasure of Sierra Madre is one of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk; and the movie can take a place, without blushing, among the best ever made.",fresh
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,John Huston has rarely been in better form than in this 1948 study of gold fever and worse obsessions among an unlikely trio of prospectors...,fresh
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,There's a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter.,fresh
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"The movie has never really been about gold but about character, and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic, frightened, selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him, if he were not so undeserving of pity.",fresh
The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"Greed, a despicable passion out of which other base ferments may spawn, is seldom treated in the movies with the frank and ironic contempt that is vividly manifested toward it in Treasure of Sierra Madre.",fresh

Duck Soup,Duck Soup should make practically everybody laugh.,fresh
Duck Soup,The Marx Brothers' best movie...,fresh
Duck Soup,"It also includes what is perhaps the Brothers' funniest scene ever: an immaculately timed and performed sequence with a broken mirror in which Groucho, Chico and Harpo look absolutely identical. A masterpiece.",fresh
Duck Soup,"This production is, for the most part, extremely noisy without being nearly as mirthful as [the Marx brothers'] other films.",rotten
Duck Soup,"The Marx Brothers created a body of work in which individual films are like slices from the whole, but Duck Soup (1933) is probably the best.",fresh
Better Off Dead...,"The film doesn't seem to have much of a focus. But it doesn't seem to want one, either.",fresh
The Shining,A masterpiece.,fresh
The Shining,Kubrick has made a movie that will have to be reckoned with on the highest level.,fresh
The Shining,"As a ghost story and adaptation of the Stephen King novel, it's largely a failure. On the other hand, as an example of directorial bravura and as a study of madness and the unreliable narrator, it's a brilliant success.",fresh
The Shining,"Kubrick is after a cool, sunlit vision of hell, born in the bosom of the nuclear family, but his imagery -- with its compulsive symmetry and brightness -- is too banal to sustain interest, while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense.",rotten
The Shining,The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them.,fresh
The Shining,"With everything to work with, director Stanley Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.",rotten
The Shining,I fear all work and no play has made Stanley a dull boy.,rotten
The Shining,"Kubrick isn't out for screams, but he manages to make his movie thoroughly unnerving by keeping the horror so close to home.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"Just when things start getting too grisly, Raimi rushes in with a hilarious, sendup joke to remind us that all this blood and guts is meant in spooky Grand Guignol fun.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"Evil Dead 2 is, pardon the expression, consistently lively -- a ghoulish splatter comedy that uses wildly excessive gore to provoke the kind of shock that lies between a laugh and a scream.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"Good acting would not have served the material well, since it would have diluted the comedy quotient and made the campy elements seem cheap and cheesy.",fresh
Evil Dead II,A flashy good-natured display of special effects and scare tactics so extreme they can only be taken for laughs.,fresh
Evil Dead II,"The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark.",rotten
Evil Dead II,"Delirious, demented and diabolically funny.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"Genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"If you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2.",fresh
Evil Dead II,"The acting is straight out of '50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?",fresh
The Deer Hunter,Is it as good as its advance word and nine Academy Award nominations suggest? Yes.,fresh
The Deer Hunter,"This excruciatingly violent, three-hour Viet Nam saga demolishes the moral and ideological cliches of an era: it shoves the audience into hell and leaves it stranded without a map.",fresh
The Deer Hunter,The film is ambitious and it succeeds on a number of levels and it proves that Cimino is an important director who deserves to be watched carefully.,fresh
The Deer Hunter,"A disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans stands at the center of this Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies from a small industrial town.",rotten
The Deer Hunter,This is probably one of the few great films of the decade.,fresh
The Deer Hunter,It is a heartbreakingly effective fictional machine that evokes the agony of the Vietnam time.,fresh
The Deer Hunter,"Its feelings for time, place and blue-collar people are genuine, and its vision is that of an original, major new film maker.",fresh

Diva,"Diva, as a lifestyle, a fantasy, a model for alienation and solipsism and eccentricity, has gone deep into all of us.",fresh
Diva,"An elaborate, subtitled exercise in blowing hot air.",rotten
Diva,"A light-headed, fleet-footed French caper, Jean-Jacques Beineix's ultra-stylish Diva stormed the art houses when it was released in 1982, and it's still a lot of fun now -- though its hip patina feels more quaint these days than cool.",fresh
Diva,I still loved every minute of it.,fresh
Diva,"Made with wit and humor, this French stunner abounds in the go-for-broke spirit of a first film made by a talented, nervy director.",fresh
Diva,This is style as a force of nature.,fresh
Diva,"It's a supremely gorgeous and supremely shallow motion picture, but it believes in art with a capital A. And practically nobody does anymore.",fresh
Diva,Any film with this much stylistic assurance is impossible to fully resist.,fresh
Diva,"The novel touches, bizarre chases and plot twists, breathtaking camerawork by Philippe Rousselot and tension-filled editing, make Diva a superior piece of entertainment.",fresh
Diva,"Half a century later, a glut of uber-groovy meta-thrillers has blunted the novelty of Diva, but its gamboling flair is still a kick.",fresh
Diva,"The most exciting debut in years, it is unified by the extraordinary decor - colour supplement chic meets pop art surrealism - which creates a world of totally fantastic reality situated four-square in contemporary Paris.",fresh

Groundhog Day,"Groundhog Day may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis... Yet this gentle, small-scale effort is easily the most endearing film of both men's careers, a sweet and amusing surprise package.",fresh

Groundhog Day,"A movie that continually replays a single day could quickly become tedious but, strangely enough, Groundhog Day never does.",fresh
Groundhog Day,Murray's wiseacre persona is perfect for what could be saccharine material in other hands.,fresh
Groundhog Day,"Even if you applaud Bill Murray's evolution from inspired comedian to minimalist seriocomic actor, it's a relief to revisit his most varied and charming role as Phil Connors.",fresh
Groundhog Day,Bill Murray is the one veteran of the Saturday Night Live/SCTV axis who still knows how to enter into a giddy conspiracy with his audience.,fresh
Groundhog Day,"Considering that none of the characters is fresh or interesting, it's a commendable achievement that the quality of the storytelling alone keeps the movie watchable and likable.",fresh
Groundhog Day,[Murray] carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in.,fresh
Groundhog Day,Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained. He wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality.,fresh
Groundhog Day,"Since arriving as a mild success in 1993, Groundhog Day has gradually achieved the status of beloved. The American Film Institute rates it No.34 on its list of all-time funniest movies, and it's a story that bears frequent repeat viewings.",fresh
Groundhog Day,"Ramis directs this surreal suburban fantasy with an admirably light touch, revelling in its absurd repetitions, surprising us with narrative ellipses, and allowing Murray ample space to indulge his special mix of sarcasm and smarm.",fresh
Groundhog Day,"Mr. Murray is back in top form with a clever, varied role that draws upon the full range of his talents.",fresh

Unforgiven,"Eastwood's meditation on age, repute, courage, heroism -- on all those burdens he has been carrying with such good grace for decades.",fresh

Unforgiven,"In three decades of climbing into the saddle, Eastwood has never ridden so tall.",fresh
Unforgiven,"Jumps adroitly between the macho and anti-macho, the romantic and anti-romantic.",fresh
Unforgiven,"By now ... Eastwood has little more than a paint-by-numbers approach to acting. As a result, we relate to Munny more as a compendium of Eastwood's earlier characters.",rotten
Unforgiven,This is the best work Eastwood has done as a director since The Outlaw Josey Wales 16 years ago.,fresh
Unforgiven,"Enjoy it for the handsome wide-screen vistas, the interplay of the actors, the classical sweep of its story line. Just don't expect the new, soul-searching Eastwood to be any more dramatically convincing than the old.",fresh
Pump Up the Volume,"The perfectly cast Slater effectively propels the film, his intensity and dry delivery giving it a definite edge, as does a soundtrack which includes Ice T, Concrete Blonde and the Cowboy Junkies.",fresh
Pump Up the Volume,"It's a howl from the heart, a relentlessly involving movie that gives a kid every reason to believe that he or she can come of age.",fresh

Back to the Future,Director Robert Zemeckis confronts the oedipal heart of the time-travel genre with this zestfully tasteless 1985 tale about a teenager (Michael J. Fox) who is projected back to 1955 and then must arrange the romance of his parents.,fresh
Back to the Future,The movie has all the benign good nature of a Frank Capra.,fresh

Young Frankenstein,Wilder's hysteria seems perfectly natural. You never question what's driving him to it; his fits are lucid and total. They take him into a different dimension -- he delivers what Harpo promised.,fresh
Young Frankenstein,"More about the myth of Karloff than the monster, this Mel Brooks pastiche is probably his best early film.",fresh
Young Frankenstein,"For a really delightful parody, James Whale's own Bride of Frankenstein is far better value.",fresh
Young Frankenstein,It shows artistic growth and a more sure-handed control of the material by a director who once seemed willing to do literally anything for a laugh. It's more confident and less breathless.,fresh
Young Frankenstein,"Some of the gags don't work, but fewer than in any previous Brooks film that I've seen, and when the jokes are meant to be bad, they are riotously poor. What more can one ask of Mel Brooks?",fresh

Crash,The best parts of Crash are as good as they are because they confront us with behaviour we might be capable of under the same circumstances. And we're not bad people. Are we?,fresh
Crash,"And so Crash raises the question: If racism is so pervasive in our society, why do we need such an elaborately contrived plot to drive home the message? In other words: How many racists does it take to screw in the point?",rotten

Chasing Amy,"Smith is at his best when he's letting his movie be silly. The more he chases significance, the more Chasing Amy fails to find its way.",fresh
Chasing Amy,Can a script exploring some truly deep questions about human sexuality and emotions be any shoddier and wooden? Will Miramax continue to fund one of the worst directors in the business? Don't stay tuned.,rotten

Mrs Brown,"Centering on a lesser-known chapter in the reign of Queen Victoria, this richly detailed drama about her intimate relationship with her servant that scandalized the country is extremely well-acted; Judi Dench deserves an Oscar nomination",fresh
Mrs Brown,"Dench is magnificent as Victoria, a toy-sized, black-suited, dough girl of despair, a woman slowly recovering her wits and her expectations.",fresh
Mrs Brown,''Mrs. Brown'' transcends its period setting not only with a keenly observed struggle between love and duty but also with the kind of controversy that envelops the Queen and her servant.,fresh

The Butcher Boy,"The Butcher Boy works best as a dark comedy and social satire, and is somewhat less successful as a character study of a deeply-troubled young boy whose violent impulses are fed by his unstable environment.",fresh

Titanic,"Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.",fresh
Titanic,"If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.",fresh

Titanic,How is Titanic in 3D? The answer is pretty damn dazzling.,fresh
Titanic,Cameron is a genius at instilling narrative dread and designing a hokum-drenched fairy tale of a certain size.,fresh
Titanic,"If any film should be redone in 3-D, it's ""Titanic."" And if any filmmaker should be the one doing the redoing, it's James Cameron.",fresh
Titanic,"Sure, it's corny, but there's something endearing about the tale of young love and its earnest lack of irony.",fresh
Titanic,"Like Kathy Bates' ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, ""Titanic"" is unabashedly American: It's big, brash and sometimes gauche, yet also unapologetically earnest, amazing to look at and devoted to its own cause. And it knows how to win us over.",fresh
Titanic,"Overall, for a blockbuster movie about one great big thing hitting another great big thing, the new film shows distinctly upper-deck restraint.",fresh
Titanic,"The letdown factor has been most keenly felt in conversions from 2D, but Titanic 3D shows how the ambition can be realized if the will and skill are there. We can only hope that other filmmakers follow Cameron's example.",fresh
Titanic,"But the power of Titanic didn't come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart, ""old-fashioned,"" or plain corny, depending on your perspective.",fresh
Titanic,"James Cameron's spectacular new 3-D version of ""Titanic'' is everything I'd hoped for, and more.",fresh
Twisted,This thriller seems most interested in lingering over battered and bloodied male faces.,rotten

The Big Lebowski,"The Dude and Sobchak begin as caricatures too, but they're allowed to grow into something deeper, if only because the humanist economy of the Coens' surrealist vaudeville allows for a couple of human beings within the tapestry of freaks.",rotten

The Big Lebowski,"There are more ideas here, more wacko side characters and plot curlicues than the film can support, and inevitably it deflates from having to shoulder so much.",rotten
The Big Lebowski,A genial spoof about life on the unhinged margins of L.A. that's a lot more carefully constructed than it pretends to be.,fresh

Pi,"Aronofsky, who has parlayed this movie's Sundance success into two Hollywood deals, is that rare indie filmmaker who doesn't want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He's a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.",fresh
Pi,We share Max's feelings of imminent psychological disintegration as the film probes our own insecurity in the face of the eternal. Maths meets millennial doom in one of the decade's true originals.,fresh

The Broadway Melody,Excellent bits of sound workmanship are that of camera and mike following Page and the heavy along the dance floor to pick up their conversation as they glide.,fresh
The Broadway Melody,"The staging is wooden, the story insipid, and the dialogue sequences mostly painful, but the film's integration of song, dance, and story was a clear narrative advance over the music pictures being released by Warner Brothers and Fox.",fresh

Out of Africa,"The relationship of Karen and Denys is a prickly and, despite the era in which it is set, curiously modern one. It's also at the heart of this understated movie.",fresh
Out of Africa,"Streep may convince us utterly that she is in love with Africa, but our views of it are a little too stately to really feel the place.",rotten
Out of Africa,My basic problem with this otherwise sumptuous and well-acted film is that I never was able to accept Redford in character.,rotten
Out of Africa,"Out of Africa is, at last, the free-spirited, fullhearted gesture that everyone has been waiting for the movies to make all decade long. It reclaims the emotional territory that is rightfully theirs.",fresh
Out of Africa,"Maybe the problem of the pacing is simply the nature of the beast these days with expensive period pieces. Once the difficult details are all in place, it may be too much to expect a director to resist milking every scene for more than it's worth.",rotten
Out of Africa,"Sydney Pollack applies craftsmanship and restraint to a classic plot curve of longing, fulfillment, and loss, and although the denouement is a bit overextended, he never yields to facile, insistent sentimentality -- his effects are honestly won.",fresh
Out of Africa,"For all that it may come out of Africa, the film's final destination is not many miles from Disneyland.",rotten
Out of Africa,"With the exception of Miss Streep's performance, the pleasures of Out of Africa are all peripheral -- David Watkin's photography, the landscapes, the shots of animal life -all of which would fit neatly into a National Geographic layout.",rotten
Out of Africa,"Out of Africa is a great movie to look at, breathtakingly filmed on location. It is a movie with the courage to be about complex, sweeping emotions, and to use the star power of its actors without apology.",fresh
Out of Africa,It tells a grand love story in less-than-grand fashion but is nevertheless worth seeing because of all the other things it does right.,fresh
The Last Emperor,"It is a hesitant, conservative approach that yields great elegance and a rhythm that carries the viewer along. Yet the film is haunted by a sense of opportunities not taken, of an artist deliberately reining in his artistry.",fresh
The Last Emperor,"If there is such a thing as voluptuous detachment, Bertolucci and John Lone have found it. Lone's achievement in his absorbing account of Pu Yi is to place him at a distance and yet make his plight totally involving.",fresh
The Last Emperor,"There's probably a truly great movie in the story of Pu Yi, but The Last Emperor is not that movie. Still, what director Bernardo Bertolucci (Last Tango in Paris) has accomplished here is both ambitious and impressive.",fresh

The Last Emperor,Constantly absorbing and tremendously interesting.,fresh
The Last Emperor,"John Lone is superb as the sad mediocrity; and if spectacle finally triumphs over sympathy, it is not without a decent struggle.",fresh
The Last Emperor,"It's a tribute to the film's intelligence and its feeling for dialectics that it views both the Forbidden City and the detention center as prisons, and that when Pu Yi winds up as a gardener there's a sense of gain as well as loss.",fresh
The Last Emperor,The Last Emperor is like an elegant travel brochure. It piques the curiosity. One wants to go. Ultimately it's a let-down.,rotten
The Last Emperor,Everything involving the life of Pu Yi was a waste. Everything except one thing: the notion that a single human life could have infinite value.,fresh
The Last Emperor,A remarkable achievement.,fresh

Rain Man,Everything about the acting and direction of Rain Man is so exquisitely calibrated and so right that it's all too easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.,fresh
Rain Man,"A fascinating, often very moving, frequently funny film.",fresh
Rain Man,"It's an honorable effort, touched by a certain lightness and grace.",fresh
Rain Man,"What no one can argue is that Rain Man is Cruise's quantum leap, so that it can be said unblushingly that he holds his own with the masterly Hoffman.",fresh
Rain Man,"The strength of the film is really that of Cruise's performance, his finest since Risky Business.",fresh
Rain Man,"Rain Man's restraint is, finally, rather like Raymond's gabble. It discourages connections, keeping you out instead of drawing you in.",rotten
Rain Man,"Uneven, slightly off-target.",rotten
Rain Man,"Valeria Golino is appealing as Cruise's girlfriend; Hoffman makes his character pretty believable without milking the part for pathos and tears, and it's nice to see Cruise working for a change in a context that isn't determined by hard sell and hype.",fresh
Rain Man,"There is no story, no motor, and given the nature of the premise, nothing much can happen.",rotten
Rain Man,"Its end effect depends largely on one's susceptibility to the sight of an actor acting nonstop and extremely well, but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose.",rotten
Rain Man,Rain Man is so fascinating because it refuses to supply those questions with sentimental but unrealistic answers.,fresh
Rain Man,Neither Levinson nor Hoffman was able to penetrate the mystery of their subject.,rotten
Rain Man,Rain Man is far from a washout but you can't help feeling all those missed opportunities raining down on you.,rotten
Driving Miss Daisy,"Driving Miss Daisy spans a quarter-century in the intricate relationship of a Southern dowager and her chauffeur, and it is a movie that invites you to appreciate the passage of time in more than one way.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give exceptional performances,fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"Freeman and Tandy have their own performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"This is a story about people, not politics. And perhaps because we can see the actors in closeup on the screen, that is even truer of the movie than the play.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"For Tandy, it's her most substantial film role since her sublime work in Alfred Hitchcock`s 1963 The Birds, and she takes full advantage of it; never playing for sympathy, she earns it completely.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"Alfred Uhry's adaptation of his Pulitzer-prizewinning play aspires more to complex observation of human behavior than to simple moralism about it. Precisely because it has its priorities straight, it succeeds superbly on both levels.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,Bruce Beresford's sensitive direction complements Alfred Uhry's skillful adapation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play.,fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,The movie also has something legitimate and instructive to say about the subtlety and intricacy of everyday race relations in the south during the period covered (roughly 1948 to '73).,fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,Far too cosy to serve as an effective social or political metaphor; better to regard it as a solid ensemble piece.,fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"There is an exhilarating, singularly theatrical lightness of touch that is often lost when these settings are made manifest in a movie.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,This is Tandy's finest two hours onscreen in a film career that goes back to 1932.,fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"The story holds a potential for sap that is mostly unfulfilled thanks to Beresford's stately approach, the stars' better judgment and the protagonists' sharp wits.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"Driving Miss Daisy is a film of great love and patience, telling a story that takes 25 years to unfold, exploring its characters as few films take the time to do.",fresh
Driving Miss Daisy,"The movie gets you mainly because Morgan Freeman, who played chauffeur Hoke Colburn in the original stage production (and won his third Obie for it), takes the wheel and drives Daisy all the way home.",fresh

Take the Money and Run,A few good laughs in an 85-minute film do not a comedy make.,rotten
Take the Money and Run,"It has plenty of hilarious jokes and concepts, like the ventriloquists' dummies at prison visiting time, and the return home from a chaingang break with five shackled cons in tow.",fresh
Take the Money and Run,"Allen has made a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy -- something very special and eccentric and funny.",fresh
Take the Money and Run,"Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments, and you'll laugh a lot, but in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie.",rotten
Klute,"[Fonda] makes all the right choices, from the mechanics of her walk and her voice inflection to the penetration of the girl's raging psyche. It is a rare performance.",fresh
Klute,"For once, a genuinely psychological thriller.",fresh
Klute,"With Fonda and Sutherland, you have actors who understand and sympathize with their characters, and you have a vehicle worthy of that sort of intelligence. So the fact that the thriller stuff doesn't always work isn't so important.",fresh
Klute,"Pakula, when he is not indulging in subjective camera, strives to give his film the look of structural geometry, but despite the sharp edges and dramatic spaces and cinema presence out of Citizen Kane, it all suggests a tepid, rather tasteless mush.",rotten
Repo Man,Repo Man has the type of unerring energy that leaves audiences breathless and entertained.,fresh
Repo Man,"Cox's style is a step beyond camp into a comedy of pure disgust; much of the film is churlishly unpleasant, but there's a core of genuine anger that gives the project an emotional validation lacking in the flabby American comedies of the early 80s.",fresh
Repo Man,"There are endless things to enjoy, from Robby Muller's crisp camerawork to a superb set of performances, from witty movie parodies to a tremendous punk soundtrack.",fresh
Repo Man,"Repo Man comes out of left field, has no big stars, didn't cost much, takes chances, dares to be unconventional, is funny, and works. There is a lesson here.",fresh
Repo Man,"It's very entertaining, and though it's rude in an R-rated way, it has the good taste never to promise more than it can deliver.",fresh
Metropolitan,"Whit Stillman's crafty independent feature about wealthy Park Avenue teenagers and a middle-class boy who joins their ranks over one Christmas vacation is certainly well imagined, and impressively acted by a cast of newcomers.",fresh
Metropolitan,"Filmmaker Whit Stillman makes a strikingly original debut with Metropolitan, a glib, ironic portrait of the vulnerable young heirs to Manhattan's disappearing debutante scene.",fresh
Metropolitan,"None of Stillman's endearing characters quite fits their prescribed social context, and in its exhilarated final movement, Metropolitan finds an exit out of the stifling UHB salon.",fresh
Metropolitan,"True appreciation for this movie may be restricted to those with firsthand experience in this kind of world, or a certain upper-haute stamina.",rotten
Metropolitan,"Not very much happens in Metropolitan, and yet everything that happens is felt deeply, because the characters in this movie are still too young to have perfected their defenses against life.",fresh
Metropolitan,"Like chamber music, Metropolitan is sprightly, intimate and all too self-aware.",fresh
The Breakfast Club,"In nine hours of threatening, bickering and, eventually, poignant (but never maudlin) self-revelation, the stereotypes dissolve and re-form.",fresh
The Breakfast Club,"John Hughes's 1985 film seems meant to explain 80s youngsters to yesterday's youth, and comes to the comforting conclusion that they're just as alienated, idealistic, and vulnerable as the baby boomers of the 1960s.",fresh
The Breakfast Club,"Does director John Hughes really believe, as he writes here, that 'when you grow up, your heart dies.' It may. But not unless the brain has already started to rot with films like this.",rotten
The Breakfast Club,"An iconic movie of the '80s, with all the unappealing baggage that suggests.",rotten
The Breakfast Club,"The Breakfast Club doesn't need earthshaking revelations; it's about kids who grow willing to talk to one another, and it has a surprisingly good ear for the way they speak.",fresh
The Breakfast Club,"Mr. Hughes, having thought up the characters and simply flung them together, should have left well enough alone.",rotten
The Breakfast Club,"In The Breakfast Club, Hughes has created a surprisingly enduring motion picture that is still effective 13 years after its theatrical debut.",fresh

A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,"Mr. Patton and Miss Myers make likable teen-age heroes, and Mr. Englund actually turns Freddy into a welcome presence.",fresh
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,"Debuting director Chuck Russell elicits poor performances from most of his thesps, making it difficult to differentiate between pic's comic relief and unintended howlers.",rotten
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,"A creepy score and Russell's sure grasp of the skewed logic of nightmares helps to sustain the ambiguity between the 'real' and 'dream' worlds, while Englund's Freddie now fits like a glove.",fresh

A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,"While some of the monotonous effects are strikingly surreal, Harlin's direction creates an atmosphere which is more morbid than scary.",rotten
A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,"Though the Elm Street series contains the most intelligent premise in current genre films, none of the movies take much advantage of their potential.",rotten

Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"Sixth and final edition in the Nightmare on Elm Street feature series delivers enough violence, black humor and even a final reel in 3-D to hit paydirt with horror-starved audiences.",fresh
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,Even the much-heralded 3-D finale is murky and unimaginative.,rotten
Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"The Elm Street films have always been a cut above the competition, so to speak, with their playfully malevolent dream sequences and their mocking, ever-resourceful villain.",fresh

Friday the 13th,"For all its shoddiness, the film manages, just barely, to achieve its ignoble goals -- it delivers what it promises.",fresh

Fanny och Alexander,Utterly enthralling.,fresh
Fanny och Alexander,"A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman, not only because it exhibits Bergman's signature themes and stylistic devices, but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films.",fresh
Fanny och Alexander,[Bergman] glides beyond the mere telling of his story into a kind of hypnotic series of events that have the clarity and fascination of dreams. Rarely have I felt so strongly during a movie that my mind had been shifted into a different kind of reality.,fresh

Matewan,"The movie works the way Westerns have always worked: In clear, simple terms and with straightforward dramatic devices.",fresh
Matewan,"Matewan is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course like a train coming down the track.",fresh
Matewan,"The result is witty, astute, and finally very moving.",fresh
Matewan,"Mr. Sayles's screenplay goes back to Shakespearean fundamentals... I suspect, however, that this seeming artlessness is a conscious choice. It's another example of the long-lost innocence that Matewan bravely celebrates.",fresh

Midnight Run,"That old formula, handcuffed captor and captive who become buddies on the run, gets an injection of new life from the playing of the cast.",fresh
Midnight Run,"Mr. De Niro and Mr. Grodin are lunatic delights, which is somewhat more than can be said for the movie, whose mechanics keep getting in the way of the performances.",fresh
Midnight Run,"Much as he might try, Brest can't masquerade this mainstream Hollywood studio picture as an offbeat little character piece.",rotten
Midnight Run,"Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have; they work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing.",fresh
Midnight Run,"Brest propels the drama forward with planes, trains and automobiles (helicopters, too), but also makes time for De Niro, Grodin, and an excellent supporting cast, to make the frenetic ride well worth the trip.",fresh
Midnight Run,"Miraculously, De Niro and Grodin turn this sow's ear into a plausible vehicle for a buddy movie, and thanks to both of them, this movie springs to life.",fresh

Frozen River,"Frozen River, a story of abject desperation, feels so real and immediate that it plays almost like a documentary.",fresh
Frozen River,"We quickly sense that the director of this film has unusual perception, and that whatever the story and performances turn out to be, she will make the most of them.",fresh

North Country,"She's [Caro] got a good story to tell (based, loosely, on a real-life case), and a marvelous cast to help her tell it.",fresh
